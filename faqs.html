  <h3>I forgot my password. How can I reset it?</h3>

  <h3>What if my details change (e.g., phone number)?</h3>
  <p>Please update your profile as soon as possible to ensure your records are accurate, which helps with payments and communication.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Milk Record Management</h2>

  <h3>How is my milk delivery recorded?</h3>
  <p>Cooperative officials enter the quantity of milk you deliver daily into the system. After entry, you will receive a notification to confirm or dispute the recorded amount.</p>

  <h3>What happens if I disagree with the recorded milk quantity?</h3>
  <p>You can dispute the quantity by responding to the notification. The cooperative official will follow up to resolve discrepancies.</p>

  <h3>How do I confirm my deliveries?</h3>
  <p>Simply respond to the notification confirming the quantity recorded or raise any concerns if the amount is incorrect.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Payments</h2>

  <h3>How often do I get paid?</h3>
  <p>Payments are processed every 15 days based on your total milk deliveries during that period.</p>

  <h3>How will I know when I am paid?</h3>
  <p>You will receive a payment confirmation message via Mpesa Mobile Money (MoMo), stating the cooperative name, amount paid, date, and time.</p>

  <h3>Can I access my payment history?</h3>
  <p>Yes, you can view and download your payment records directly from the mobile app.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Technical and Support</h2>

  <h3>Who can I contact for support?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Farmers can contact their cooperative office or use the in-app support section.</li>
    <li>Cooperative officials can access support via the web app’s help chat or by emailing the system administrator.</li>
