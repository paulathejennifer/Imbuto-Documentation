# Problem Statement

Dairy cooperatives and farmers face challenges due to manual and fragmented management of member data, milk deliveries, and payments. This leads to administrative inefficiencies, delayed payments, communication gaps, and reduced trust, limiting the growth and sustainability of cooperatives.

This platform tackles these issues by providing an integrated, secure, and transparent system that supports cooperative officials and farmers throughout the entire operational cycle.
