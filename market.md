# Market Overview
Rwanda has an estimated 1 million smallholder dairy farmers, many organized into cooperatives.


The dairy market is growing due to rising domestic demand and government initiatives encouraging milk production.


Challenges include lack of transparency in milk collection, inconsistent payment, and manual record-keeping by cooperatives.
