# Product Vision / Proposal

## Purpose  
To build a secure, user-friendly, and reliable platform that bridges farmers and cooperative officials by digitizing and automating the management of memberships, milk deliveries, payments, and progress tracking.

## Business Rationale  
Traditional dairy cooperative processes are largely manual, resulting in delays, errors, and mistrust among stakeholders. Automating these critical workflows will improve operational efficiency, build transparency, foster trust, and ultimately increase farmer retention and cooperative profitability.

## High-Level Goals  
- Deliver a secure authentication system accommodating different user roles  
- Enable seamless member registration and profile management  
- Implement real-time milk delivery tracking and notifications  
- Automate payment schedules and transaction confirmations  
- Provide visual analytics to support data-driven decisions  
- Ensure scalable, maintainable architecture using modern technologies (Django, React, PostgreSQL)
